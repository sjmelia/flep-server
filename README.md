# Flep! Server

This is a dotnetcore REST service for the Flep! App; available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arrayofbytes.flep&hl=en)

This is still WIP and there's a lot of code cleanup left to do.

* Install dotnetcore (see [this installation guide](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxdebian))
* run `dotnet restore` to restore nuget packages.
* run `run_dev.sh` or `run_prod.sh` which will provide a fix for [this issue](https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/963)
